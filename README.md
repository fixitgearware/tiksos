|  <strong>Python</strong>  |     whereis python not working.  | 1. Run the code below: <br><strong>sudo apt-get install python3</strong> (This will install the python afresh)<br> 2. Next to ensure we can locate python we need to type the command below:<br><strong>sudo apt install python-is-python3.</strong><br>(This will install the library which we can use to use the following command below. Also, this command fixes everything including the location of other tools in our Kali-virtual box).<br>3. To locate python in our VirtualBox, and ensure everything is accurately installed, we can type the following command below:<br><strong>type python</strong><br><strong>type python2</strong><br><strong>type python3</strong><br><strong>command -v python</strong><br><strong>type -a python</strong>|
|  <strong>Burpsuite</strong>  |    Installation.  | 1. Type the command below, to check for the version of installed Burpsuite.<br><strong>Burpsuite -v</strong><br>[fires up burpsuite, and shows which version]<br>2.Head to Portswigger academy, to download the <strong>*.jar</strong> file for Burpsuite into your computer.<br>3. Navigate to Downloads on your Kali.Using the <strong>“cd Downloads”</strong> command, in your terminal.<br>4.From the download directory, type the command below, to rename the <strong>*.jar</strong>file of the version of Burpsuite downloaded. <br><strong> sudo mv burpsuite_community_v2023.11.1.3.jar burpsuite</strong><br> This will rename “burpsuite_community_v2023.11.1.3.jar” to “Burpsuite”<br>5. Next while still in the download directory, run the command below to move the latest burpsuite <strong>*.jar</strong> file, to the bin directory:<br><strong>chmod +x burpsuite && sudo mv burpsuite/usr/bin/burpsuite</strong><br>After this has been done, launch your burpsuite.|
|  <strong>VirtualBox </strong>  |     shared folder issues and Drag-Drop Between Host Machine and VBox.  | 1. Go to oracle website url below, and download latest VirtualBox file and guest addition e.g. this is version 7.0.14:<br> https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.14/<br> 2. shutdown the kali-Linux running on the VirtualBox machine, and then close the VirtualBox machine to install the latest version.<br>3. Next download & install the VirtualBox extension pack latest version, by visiting the link below.<br>:https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.14/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-7.0.14.vbox-extpack <br><strong>Note the version would vary, this is just a demo example.</strong><br>4. Launch your VirtualBox machine, and select the specific machine having this issue, and go to settings, to add the <strong>"virtualbox guest addition"</strong>, to the boot-sector. Here we are assuming your VirtualBox, is running multiple VM’s. <br>5. Start the machine, and then login with your credentials. <br>6. Upon login, you will see the <strong>CD icon (Disk Icon)</strong>, click on it, to view the entire content or files. <br>7.Then scroll down to the end, and <strong>right click</strong>, select <strong>“open-in-terminal”</strong><br>8. Next type the command below, to list all the files: <br><strong>ls -la</strong><br> 9. Look for the file name <strong>"VboxLinuxAdditions.run"</strong>and copy it.<br>10. Next we need to give permissions to the file, by typing the command below:<br><strong>chmod +x VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</strong><br>11. Then finally to install VirtualBox guest addition, we run the command below:<br><strong> sudo sh ./VboxLinuxAdditions.run</strong><br>12.Reboot system and Login. That's all.|
|  <strong>VirtualBox </strong>  |     Error notification popping up after installing Guest Additions.  |1. Type the command below to troubleshoot and reboot the Kali-Linux OS <br><strong>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y virtualbox-guest-* && reboot</strong><br>2. Upon reboot, type the command below in the terminal.<br><strong>sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms</strong><br><br><strong>NOTE: The drag and drop functionality only work for older version of virtualbox machine. Since the latest update release, the drag and drop between HOST and GUEST machine, has been discontinued. Virtualbox now supports only shared folder functionality.</strong>|
